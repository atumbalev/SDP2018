# Binary File

TODO

## Problem

Create a class student with the following fields: faculty number, name and grade and methods that can serialize it to text/binary file and also load it from text/binary file\
Create a class that will be associated with a binary file that serializes a number of students that supports the following operations\
	- Contruct the class from a given size n by associating it with a newly created bunary file with n "empty" students
	- Construct the class from a given text file by serializing the students from the text file to a binary file\
	- Construct the class by associating it with a given binary file\
	- Add a student to the end of the file\
	- Given an index replace the student on that line with an "empty" student\
	- Given an index and a student replace the student on that line with the given one\
	- Given an index, return the Student on that line in the binary file\
	- break GDPR by printing the data for every student in the file on the screen- print the data for every student in the file that has a given property (e.g. every student whose name starts with "P" or every student with >3 grade)\  
	- sort the students in the binary file by grade\
